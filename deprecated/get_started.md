# Get started

This section of the documentation contains guides on how to connect wallets to B² network, deploy new or existing Ethereum smart contracts, and bridge assets between B² Network and Bitcoin.

Developers can herein find guides to setting up an RPC zkNode, spinning up a production zkNode, or even implementing their own fully-fledged zkEVM.

B² Network is fully compatible with Ethereum to provide a complete EVM-like UX for both Developers and Users.

Users do not need any special toolings or wallets in order to build or interact with B² Rollup.

Simply switch to the B² RPC and start building on a network with a higher throughput and lower fees.
